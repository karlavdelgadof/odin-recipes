#Introduction
The Odin Recipes project is a simple website created with HTML and CSS.
The making of this project aims to test and apply all of the HTML and CSS knowledge I have been acquiring in the past few weeks. Therefore, I demonstrate myself capable of creating a website from the start by using both HTML and CSS programming languages.
